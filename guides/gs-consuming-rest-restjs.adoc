This guide walks you through the process of consuming a simple rest.js
client that consumes a Spring MVC-based link:/understanding/REST[RESTful web service].

== What you'll build

You will build a rest.js client that consumes a Spring-based RESTful web service.
Specifically, the client will consume the service created in
{gs-rest-service-cors}[Building a RESTful Web Service with CORS].

The rest.js client will be accessed by opening the `index.html` file in
your browser, and will consume the service accepting requests at:

    http://rest-service.guides.spring.io/greeting

The service will respond with a link:/understanding/JSON[JSON] representation of a greeting:

[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----

The client will render the ID and content into the DOM.

You can customize the greeting with an optional *query string* in the url:

    http://localhost:8080/?User

The code will send a parameter to the REST endpoint and
render a custom greeting into the DOM.


== What you'll need

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor
 - A modern web browser
 - An internet connection
 - Node.js and link:/understanding/Git[Git] pre-installed
 - Bower installed as a global node.js link:/understanding/javascript-package-managers[JavaScript package]

[[scratch]]
[[initial]]
== Create bower configuration files

First, create a bower control file, `.bowerrc`.  This file tells bower
where to put the JavaScript dependencies.  The `.bowerrc` file should
be located at the root of the project (+{project_id}/initial+) and
formatted as JSON:

`.bowerrc`
[source,txt]
----
include::complete/.bowerrc[]
----

From a command prompt at the root of the project, run `bower init`.
This will create a `bower.json` file that describes each
link:/understanding/javascript-package-managers[JavaScript package]
required by the project.  Bower will ask for several
bits of information such as a project name, license, etc.  If in doubt,
just press `Enter` to accept the defaults.

Next, use Bower to install rest.js and an
link:/understanding/javascript-modules[AMD module]
loader such as curl.js.  From the command prompt, type:

----
bower install --save rest#~1
----

----
bower install --save curl#~0.8
----

Bower will install rest.js and curl.js into the directory we listed
in `.bowerrc`.  Since we specified the `--save` option, bower will
store the package information in the `bower.json` file.

NOTE: Bower should discover that rest.js depends on when.js
and install a compatible version.

When done, the `bower.json` file should have a "dependencies"
object property that lists "curl" and "rest" as property names and
their semver information as values:

`bower.json`
[source,json]
----
include::complete/bower.json[]
----


== Create a render module

First, create a render function to inject data into an HTML document.

`public/hello/render.js`
[source,js]
----
include::complete/public/hello/render.js[]
----

This link:/understanding/javascript-modules[AMD module] uses simple DOM
querying and manipulation to inject text
into the document.  To ensure that the DOM is not used before it is
ready, the render module imports and uses curl.js's `domReady`
function-module.

NOTE: In a real application, you'll want to use *data binding* or
*templating*, rather than DOM manipulation as shown here.


== Create an application composition module

Next, create a module that will compose the application.

`public/hello/main.js`
[source,js]
----
include::complete/public/hello/main.js[]
----

The main module reads the query string from the document's location
object, configures a rest.js mime client, and calls the REST endpoint.

rest.js returns a link:/understanding/javascript-promises[Promises/A+ promise],
which will call the `render` function-module when the endpoint returns
data.  The `render` function expects the entity, but the rest.js client
normally returns a response object.  The "rest/interceptor/entity"
interceptor plucks the entity from the response and forwards that
onto the `render` function.


== Create a boot script

Next, create the boot script, `run.js`:

`public/run.js`
[source,js]
----
include::complete/public/run.js[]
----

This script configures the AMD loader: `curl.config()`.  The `main`
configuration property tells curl.js where to find the application's
main module, which will be fetched and evaluated automatically.
The `packages` config object tells curl.js where to find modules
in our application's packages or in third-party packages.


== Create the application page

Finally, create an `index.html` file and add the following HTML:

`public/index.html`
[source,html]
----
include::complete/public/index.html[]
----

The `script` element loads curl.js and then loads an *application boot
script* named "run.js".  The boot script initializes and configures
an AMD module environment and then starts the client-side application code.


[[run]]
== Run the client

To run the client, you'll need to serve it from a web server to your browser. The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) includes an embedded Tomcat server, which offers a simple approach to serving web content. See {gs-spring-boot}[Building an Application with Spring Boot] for more information about installing and using the CLI.

In order to serve static content from Spring Boot's embedded Tomcat server, you'll also need to create a minimal amount of web application code so that Spring Boot knows to start Tomcat. The following `app.groovy` script is sufficient for letting Spring Boot know that you want to run Tomcat:

`app.groovy`
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/app.groovy[]
----

You can now run the app using the Spring Boot CLI:

----
spring run app.groovy
----

Once the app starts, open http://localhost:8080 in your browser, where you see:

image::images/hello.png[Model data retrieved from the REST service is rendered into the DOM.]

The ID value will increment each time you refresh the page.


== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a rest.js client that consumes a
Spring-based RESTful web service.
