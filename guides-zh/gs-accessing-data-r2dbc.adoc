This guide walks you through the process of building an application that uses Spring Data R2DBC to store and retrieve data in a relational database using reactive database drivers.

== What you'll build

You will build an application that stores `Customer` POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) in a memory-based database.


== What you'll need

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the set up for you. This example needs the R2DBC and H2
dependencies. The following image shows the Initializr set up for this sample project:

image::images/initializr.png[]

NOTE: The preceding image shows the Initializr with Maven chosen as the build tool. You
can also use Gradle. It also shows values of `com.example` and `accesing-data-r2dbc` as the
Group and Artifact, respectively. You will use those values throughout the rest of this sample.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file created when you choose Maven:

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file created when you choose Gradle:

[[initial]]
== Define a Schema

In this example, you store `Customer` objects, each annotated as a R2DBC entity. The
following listing shows the SQL schema class (in `src/main/resources/schema.sql`):

====
[source,sql,indent=0]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/schema.sql[]
----
====

Here you have a `customer` table with three columns: `id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.
The `id` column is auto-incremented, the other columns follow the default snake case naming scheme.
Spring Boot's auto-configuration picks up the `schema.sql` file during application startup to initialize the database schema.

[[entity]]
== Define a Simple Entity

In this example, you store `Customer` objects, each annotated as a R2DBC entity. The
following listing shows the Customer class (in
	`src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/Customer.java`):

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/Customer.java[]
----
====

Here you have a `Customer` class with three attributes: `id`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.
The `Customer` class is minimally annotated. The `id` property is annotated with `@Id` so that Spring Data R2DBC can identify the primary key.
By default, primary keys are assumed to be generated by the database on `INSERT`.

The other two properties, `firstName` and `lastName`, are left unannotated. It is assumed
that they are mapped to columns that share the same names as the properties themselves.

The convenient `toString()` method print outs the customer's properties.


== Create Simple Queries

Spring Data R2DBC focuses on using R2DBC as underlying technology to store data in a relational database.
Its most compelling feature is the ability to create repository implementations, at runtime, from a repository interface.

To see how this works, create a repository interface that works with `Customer` entities
as the following listing (in `src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/CustomerRepository.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/CustomerRepository.java[]
----
====

`CustomerRepository` extends the `ReactiveCrudRepository` interface. The type of entity and ID  that it works with, `Customer` and `Long`, are specified in the generic parameters on `ReactiveCrudRepository`.
By extending `ReactiveCrudRepository`, `CustomerRepository` inherits several methods for working with `Customer` persistence, including methods for saving, deleting, and finding `Customer` entities using reactive types.

Spring Data R2DBC also lets you define other query methods by annotating these with `@Query`.
For example, `CustomerRepository` includes the `findByLastName()` method.

In a typical Java application, you might expect to write a class that implements `CustomerRepository`.
However, that is what makes Spring Data R2DBC so powerful: You need not write an implementation of the repository interface.
Spring Data R2DBC creates an implementation when you run the application.

Now you can wire up this example and see what it looks like!

== Create an Application Class

Spring Initializr creates a simple class for the application. The following listing shows
the class that Initializr created for this example (in
`src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/AccessingDataR2dbcApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/AccessingDataR2dbcApplication.java[]
----
====

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application-new-path.adoc[]

Now you need to modify the simple class that the Initializr created for you.
To get output (to the console, in this example), you need to set up a logger.
Then you need to set up some data and use it to generate output.
The following listing shows the finished `AccessingDataR2dbcApplication` class (in `src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/AccessingDataR2dbcApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatar2dbc/AccessingDataR2dbcApplication.java[]
----
====

The `AccessingDataR2dbcApplication` class includes a `main()` method that puts the `CustomerRepository` through a few tests.
First, it fetches the `CustomerRepository` from the Spring application context.
Then it saves a handful of `Customer` objects, demonstrating the `save()` method and setting up some data to use.
Next, it calls `findAll()` to fetch all `Customer` objects from the database.
Then it calls `findById()` to fetch a single `Customer` by its ID.
Finally, it calls `findByLastName()` to find all customers whose last name is "Bauer".

R2DBC is a reactive programming technology.
At the same time we're using it in a synchronized, imperative flow and that is why we're required to synchronize each call with a variant of the `block(â€¦)` method.
In a typical reactive application, the resulting `Mono` or `Flux` would represent a pipeline of operators that is handed back to a web controller or event processor that subscribes to the reactive sequence without blocking the calling thread.

NOTE: By default, Spring Boot enables R2DBC repository support and looks in the package (and its subpackages) where `@SpringBootApplication` is located.
If your configuration has R2DBC repository interface definitions located in a package that is not visible, you can point out alternate packages by using `@EnableR2dbcRepositories` and its type-safe `basePackageClasses=MyRepository.class` parameter.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

When you run your application, you should see output similar to the following:

====
----
== Customers found with findAll():
Customer[id=1, firstName='Jack', lastName='Bauer']
Customer[id=2, firstName='Chloe', lastName='O'Brian']
Customer[id=3, firstName='Kim', lastName='Bauer']
Customer[id=4, firstName='David', lastName='Palmer']
Customer[id=5, firstName='Michelle', lastName='Dessler']

== Customer found with findOne(1L):
Customer[id=1, firstName='Jack', lastName='Bauer']

== Customer found with findByLastName('Bauer'):
Customer[id=1, firstName='Jack', lastName='Bauer']
Customer[id=3, firstName='Kim', lastName='Bauer']
----
====

== Summary

Congratulations! You have written a simple application that uses Spring Data R2DBC to save objects to and fetch them from a database, all without writing a concrete repository implementation.
