This guide walks you through the process of applying circuit breakers to potentially
failing method calls by using the Netflix Hystrix fault tolerance library.

== What You Will Build

You will build a microservice application that uses the
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html[circuit breaker pattern] to gracefully
degrade functionality when a method call fails. Use of the Circuit Breaker pattern can let
a microservice continue operating when a related service fails, preventing the failure
from cascading and giving the failing service time to recover.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the set up for you.

This guide needs two applications. The first application (a simple bookstore site) needs
only the Web dependency. The following image shows the Initializr set up for the
bookstore:

image::images/initializr-bookstore.png[]

NOTE: The preceding image shows the Initializr with Maven chosen as the build tool. You
can also use Gradle. It also shows values of `com.example` and
`circuit-breaker-bookstore` as the Group and Artifact, respectively. You will use those
values throughout the rest of this sample.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file (for the configuration service) that is
created when you choose Maven:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::complete/bookstore/pom.xml[]
----
====

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file (for the configuration service) that
is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[src,groovy]
----
include::complete/bookstore/build.gradle[]
----
====

The second application (the reading application, which will use a Hystrix circuit breaker)
needs the Web and Hystrix dependencies. The following image shows the Initializr set up
for the configuration client:

image::images/initializr-reading.png[]

NOTE: The preceding image shows the Initializr with Maven chosen as the build tool. You
can also use Gradle. It also shows values of `com.example` and
`circuit-breaker-reading` as the Group and Artifact, respectively. You will use those
values throughout the rest of this sample.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file (for the configuration client) that is
created when you choose Maven:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::complete/reading/pom.xml[]
----
====

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file (for the configuration client) that
is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[src,groovy]
----
include::complete/reading/build.gradle[]
----
====

NOTE: For convenience, we have provided build files (a `pom.xml` file and a `build.gradle`
file) at the top of the complete and initial projects (one directory above the `bookstore`
and `reading` directories) that you can use to build both the bookstore project and the
reading project at once. We also added the Maven and Gradle wrappers there.

== Set up a Server Microservice Application

The Bookstore service will have a single endpoint. It will be accessible at `/recommended`
and will (for simplicity) return a recommended reading list as a `String`.

You need to make your main class in `BookstoreApplication.java`. It should look like the
following listing (from
`bookstore/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerbookstore/CircuitBreakerBookstoreApplication.java`):

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/bookstore/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerbookstore/CircuitBreakerBookstoreApplication.java[]
----
====

The `@RestController` annotation indicates that `BookstoreApplication` is a REST
controller class and ensures that any `@RequestMapping` methods in this class behave as
though annotated with `@ResponseBody`. That is, the return values of `@RequestMapping`
methods in this class are automatically and appropriately converted from their original
types and are written directly to the response body.

You are going to run this application locally alongside an application with a consuming
application. As a result, in `src/main/resources/application.properties`, you need to set
`server.port` so that the Bookstore service cannot conflict with the consuming application
when we get that running. The following listing (from
`bookstore/src/main/resources/application.properties`) shows how to do so:

====
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/bookstore/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----
====

== Set up a Client Microservice Application

The reading application will be your consumer (modeling visitors) for the bookstore
application. You can view your reading list there at `/to-read`, and that reading list is
retrieved from the bookstore service application. The following example (from
`reading/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading/CircuitBreakerReadingApplication.java`)
shows this class:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading/CircuitBreakerReadingApplication.java[]
----
====

To get the list from your bookstore, you can use Spring's `RestTemplate` template class.
`RestTemplate` makes an HTTP GET request to the bookstore service's URL and returns the
result as a `String`. (For more information on using Spring to consume a RESTful service,
see the https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/[Consuming a RESTful Web Service]
guide.) To do so, you need to add the `server.port` property to
`reading/src/main/resources/application.properties`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----
====

You now can access, in a browser, the `/to-read` endpoint of your reading application and
see your reading list. However, since we rely on the bookstore application, if anything
happens to it or if the reading application is unable to access Bookstore, you will have
no list and your users will get a nasty HTTP 500 error message.

== Apply the Circuit Breaker Pattern

Netflix's Hystrix library provides an implementation of the circuit breaker pattern. When
you apply a circuit breaker to a method, Hystrix watches for failing calls to that method,
and, if failures build up to a threshold, Hystrix opens the circuit so that subsequent
calls automatically fail. While the circuit is open, Hystrix redirects calls to the
method, and they are passed to your specified fallback method.

Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix looks for any method annotated with the `@HystrixCommand`
annotation and wraps that method in a proxy connected to a circuit breaker so that Hystrix
can monitor it. This currently works only in a class marked with `@Component` or
`@Service`. Therefore, in the reading application, under
`src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading`, you need to add a new class (called
`BookService`).

The `RestTemplate` is injected into the constructor of the `BookService` when it is
created. The following listing (from
`reading/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading/BookService.java` shows the
`BookService` class):

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading/BookService.java[]
----
====

You have applied `@HystrixCommand` to your original `readingList()` method. You also have
a new method here: `reliable()`. The `@HystrixCommand` annotation has `reliable` as its
`fallbackMethod`. If, for some reason, Hystrix opens the circuit on `readingList()`, you
have an excellent (if short) placeholder reading list ready for your users.

In our main class, `ReadingApplication`, you need to create a `RestTemplate` bean, inject
the `BookService`, and call it for your reading list. The following example (from
`reading/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading/CircuitBreakerReadingApplication.java`)
shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/reading/src/main/java/com/example/circuitbreakerreading/CircuitBreakerReadingApplication.java[]
----
====

Now, to retrieve the list from the Bookstore service, you can call
`bookService.readingList()`. You should also add one last annotation,
`@EnableCircuitBreaker`. That annotation tells Spring Cloud that the reading application
uses circuit breakers and to enable their monitoring, opening, and closing (behavior
supplied, in our case, by Hystrix).

== Try It

To test your circuit breaker, run both the bookstore service and the reading service and
then open a browser to the reading service, at `localhost:8080/to-read`. You should see
the complete recommended reading list, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
Spring in Action (Manning), Cloud Native Java (O'Reilly), Learning Spring Boot (Packt)
----
====

Now stop the bookstore application. Your list source is gone, but thanks to Hystrix and
Spring Cloud Netflix, you have a reliable abbreviated list to stand in the gap. You should
see the following:

====
[source,text]
----
Cloud Native Java (O'Reilly)
----
====

== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a Spring application that uses the circuit
breaker pattern to protect against cascading failures and to provide fallback behavior for
potentially failing calls.
